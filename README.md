# Predicting_Quality_of_Wine

This is a jupiter notebook that was published on Kaggle.

The notebook is about using data to help with picking wine.

The data set used is a data set from University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository called Wine Quality Data Set. The data set consist of red vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal.

A Extreme Gradient Boosting model and a Deep Neural Network model was used to predict the quality score (1-10) from the chemical properties of the wine. The python libary eli5 was used for machince learning explainability.
